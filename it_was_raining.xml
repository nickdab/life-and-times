		<body>I miss her. Even today I miss her. Without her, sometimes I feel like my apartment is my cell. Like when I'm driving to work, I'm on a treadmill. I just keep doing the same thing, every day, going nowhere but still taking the steps. Sometimes I feel ok. But sometimes, especially when it's late at night, and I'm just lying there, listening to that rain hitting the window--she's there again.</body>
